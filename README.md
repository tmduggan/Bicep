# Exercise Logger Web App

This is a simple web application for logging exercise data in two categories:

- **Distance & Time** (e.g., running, cycling) — using miles and minutes
- **Weight & Reps** (e.g., bench press, squats) — using pounds and reps

## Features
- Log new workouts with intuitive forms
- Select from previously entered exercises via a dropdown
- Chronological log of all workouts (most recent at the top)
- Clean, modern UI/UX with icon-based actions (edit, delete)
- Data persists in local storage (no backend required)
